Project developed by Marco Praderio as part of a curse in Arithmetic at the university of Barcelona.
This project implements various factorization algorithms as well as multiple primality tests.
The main.py script can run almost entirely without installing any additional modules.
However it is necessary to install sagemath in order to execute the factorization algorithms
'garbell_quadratic' and 'Dixon'.
The script can be run from the command line by simply executing either one of the following commands.

sage main.py -n (number) --algorithm (algorithm) --primality-test (primality-test)
python main.py -n (number) --algorithm (algorithm) --primality-test (primality-test)

where:
(number)        Is an integer to be factorized.
(algorithm)     Is the factorization algorithm to be implemented and can be one of the following:
                Garbell_Eratostenes
                Rho_Pollard
                p-1_Pollard
                Dixon
                Garbell_quadratic
                No distinction made between minuscules and capital letters. Default is Dixon.
(primality-test)Is the primality test or tests to be used.
                It can be one or more of the following:
                trial_division
                pseudoprime_primality_test
                solovay_strassen
                miller_rabin
                No distinction made between minuscules and capital letters. Default is miller_rabin.

IMPORTANT:
Algorithms may work faster if controls for correct inputs are disabled.
